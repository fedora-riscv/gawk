Summary: printf format "%.*s" in gawk not working

Description:

Description of problem:
The bug in gawk exists in the Redhat Ent6 gawk package. The patch to fix is checked in the fedora src rpm for gawk-3.1.7-3 and is gawk-3.1.7-prec-utf8.patch.

Here a repeat of the original bug report.

The "%.*s" format string in printf no longer works.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
gawk-3.1.6-5.fc11.i586

How reproducible:
Run example from bash command line.
The example should remove the last character from the string.

Steps to Reproduce:
# echo ab123dl|gawk '{printf("%.*s\n",length($0)-1,$0)}'

Actual results:
ab123dl

Expected results:
ab123d

Additional info:
works OK with gawk-3.1.5-14.el5 and previously on fc10
